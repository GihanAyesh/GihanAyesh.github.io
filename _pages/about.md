I am a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University (MSU) starting from Fall 2024. I obtained my B.Sc. from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Moratuwa](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/). My main research interests are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My final year research was centered on developing a sentiment analysis model for colloquial Sinhala under the supervision of [Dr. Nisansa de Silva](https://nisansads.staff.uom.lk/) and [Mr. Yudhanjaya Wijeratne](https://yudhanjaya.com/). Before joining MSU for my Ph.D. I worked as a software engineer at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/).
