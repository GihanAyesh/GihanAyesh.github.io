I am a graduate in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Moratuwa](https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/). My main research interests are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My final year research was centered on developing a sentiment analysis model for colloquial Sinhala under the supervision of [Dr. Nisansa de Silva](https://nisansads.staff.uom.lk/) and [Mr. Yudhanjaya Wijeratne](https://yudhanjaya.com/). I am currently working as a software engineer at [WSO2](https://wso2.com/) and hoping to join in a PhD program in the near future.
