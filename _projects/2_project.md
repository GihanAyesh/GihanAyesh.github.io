The presentation occurred at the 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Electronics Engineering (AIEE 2022) on January 11, 2022, in Bangkok, Thailand. The core of the research revolved around training a variety of deep learning models using two separate datasets: one focused on news reactions and another dedicated to Facebook reactions.

The ultimate findings highlighted that incorporating the Facebook dataset notably enhanced the models' performance. Based on the outcomes, the most effective model identified was a 3-layer stacked BiLSTM model, marking a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art models used for this purpose.
