The presentation took place at the 21st International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer 2021) on December 2nd, 2021, held virtually amid the COVID-19 pandemic. During this session, introduction of two innovative models: the Core Reaction Set model and the All Reaction Set model was happened. These models were designed to enhance reaction prediction for Facebook posts.

The focus of the presentation was to demonstrate the efficacy of these models, individually and in combination with the Star Rating model. By comparing the outcomes, we aimed to analyze their impact on predicting user reactions to Facebook posts.
